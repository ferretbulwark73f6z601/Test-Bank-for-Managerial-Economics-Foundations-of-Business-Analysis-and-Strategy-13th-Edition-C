Author:  Christopher Thomas, S. Charles Maurice

Managerial Economics is a self-contained textbook that requires no previous training in economics. While maintaining a rigorous style, this book is designed to be one of the most accessible books in managerial economics from which to teach and learn because of its clarity of presentation and strong end of chapter problems. Rather than parading students quickly through every interesting or new topic in microeconomics and industrial organization, this 13th edition instead carefully develops and applies the most useful concepts for business decision making and strategic planning.
